1. **Why Caching & Core Concepts in Valkey**
   
   - **The Problem Caching Solves:**
     - **Slow Database Queries:** Databases are disk-bound and relatively slow compared to memory.
     - **High Load on Backend Services:** Repetitive computations or API calls can overwhelm services.
     - **Repetitive Computations:** Avoid re-calculating the same data over and over.
   - **The Solution: Valkey as a Cache:** Store frequently accessed or computationally expensive data in Valkey, a **fast, in-memory data store**.
   - **Benefits:**
     - **Lightning-Fast Response Times:** Achieve **microsecond-level latency** and support **millions of operations per second** by serving data directly from RAM.
     - **Reduced Database Load:** Alleviates stress on primary databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).
     - **Improved User Experience:** Applications feel snappier and more responsive.
     - **Lower Operational Costs:** Less strain on expensive database resources, potentially reducing infrastructure needs.
   - **Core Caching Concepts in Valkey:**
     - **In-Memory Advantage:** Valkey's fundamental strength for caching is its reliance on RAM for storage, providing unparalleled speed.
     - **Key-Value Model & Data Types:** Valkey's simple key-value model is intuitive for caching. Its rich data types (like strings for simple values, or **hashes for structured objects like user profiles or product details**) allow you to cache diverse types of data efficiently.
     - **Expiration (Time To Live - TTL):**
       - A fundamental aspect of caching to prevent serving stale data.
       - Valkey allows setting an `EXPIRE key seconds` or `SETEX key seconds value` to automatically delete keys after a timeout.
       - **Note:** Overwriting an existing key with `SET` will clear its associated TTL unless explicitly re-set.
       - Valkey reclaims expired keys both lazily (when accessed) and via a background "active expire" process for efficiency.
     - **Cache Hit vs. Cache Miss:**
       - **Cache Hit:** Data found in cache – served immediately. ✅
       - **Cache Miss:** Data not found in cache – must be fetched from the original source.
   - **The Cache-Aside Pattern (Theory & Pseudocode):** This is the **most common and intuitive caching pattern**.
     1. Application first tries to `GET` data from Valkey (the cache).
     2. **IF Cache Hit:** Data is found. Application immediately returns the cached data to the client.
     3. **ELSE Cache Miss:** Data is NOT in the cache.
        a. Application queries the primary database or backend service to get the data.
        b. Application `SET`s (or `SETEX`s) the retrieved data into Valkey (with a TTL) for future requests.
        c. Application then returns the data to the client.

2. **Practical Lab: Cache-Aside in Python**
   
   - **Key Valkey Commands (revisited):** `SETEX key seconds value` (set with expiry), `EXPIRE key seconds` (set/update expiry on existing key), `TTL key` (check remaining TTL), `PERSIST key` (remove expiry), `DEL key` (explicit invalidation).
   - **Live Coding Example:** Simulating a slow database fetch for product details.
   
   ```python
   import time
   import json
   
   # Connect to Valkey (assuming 'v' is already defined from Module 2 setup)
   # v = valkey.Valkey(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0, decode_responses=True)
   # Ensure v is accessible here, e.g., by running previous module's setup.py or passing it.
   
   print("\n--- Caching Demo: Cache-Aside Pattern ---")
   
   # --- Imagine this is your slow database function ---
   def get_product_from_db(product_id: str) -> dict:
   """A mock function to simulate a slow database call."""
   print(f"DATABASE HIT: Querying database for product {product_id}...")
   time.sleep(1.5) # Simulate network latency and query time
   # In a real app, this would be: SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = ...
   return {"id": product_id, "name": f"Luxury Widget {product_id}", "price": round(100.0 * float(product_id), 2)}
   
   # --- Caching implementation using Valkey ---
   def get_product_details(product_id: str) -> dict:
   """Gets product data using the Cache-Aside pattern with Valkey."""
   cache_key = f"product:{product_id}:details"
   CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 300 # Cache for 5 minutes
   
   # 1. Try to get from cache first
   cached_product_json = v.get(cache_key)
   
   if cached_product_json:
       # 2. CACHE HIT!
       print(f"CACHE HIT for product {product_id}!")
       return json.loads(cached_product_json)
   else:
       # 3. CACHE MISS!
       print(f"CACHE MISS for product {product_id}! Fetching from DB...")
       # 3a. Get data from primary database
       product_data = get_product_from_db(product_id)
   
       # 3b. Store data in cache for next time with a TTL
       v.set(cache_key, json.dumps(product_data), ex=CACHE_TTL_SECONDS)
       print(f"Stored product {product_id} in cache with TTL: {v.ttl(cache_key)}s")
   
       # 3c. Return the data
       return product_data
   
   # --- Demonstrate the pattern ---
   print("\n--- Testing Cache-Aside for Product 'P123' ---")
   print("1. First call (should be slow - Cache MISS):")
   start_time = time.time()
   print(get_product_details('P123'))
   print(f"Took: {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s\n")
   
   print("2. Second call (should be fast - Cache HIT):")
   start_time = time.time()
   print(get_product_details('P123'))
   print(f"Took: {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s\n")
   
   # Demonstrate cache invalidation
   print("3. Simulating update for product 'P123': Manually invalidating cache...")
   v.delete("product:P123:details") # Explicitly delete the key
   print("Cache for 'P123' invalidated.")
   
   print("4. Third call (will be slow again - Cache MISS after invalidation):")
   start_time = time.time()
   print(get_product_details('P123'))
   print(f"Took: {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s")
   ```

3. **Cache Invalidation, Eviction & Performance Enhancements**
   
   - **Cache Invalidation Strategies:**
     
     - **Time-Based (TTL/Expiration):** Most common and simplest. Data automatically expires.
     - **Event-Based / Manual Invalidation:** `DEL key` (or a more complex mechanism for related keys) when the source data changes in the primary database.
     - **Considerations:** **Cache Coherence** (keeping cache consistent with source of truth), **Cold Cache** (performance hit on first access), **Stale Data** (tolerance for data being slightly out of sync).
   
   - **Memory Management & Eviction Policies:**
     
     - When used as a cache, Valkey is often configured with a **`maxmemory` limit** to prevent it from consuming all available RAM.
     
     - Once `maxmemory` is reached, Valkey needs a strategy to decide which existing keys to remove (evict). This is controlled by the **`maxmemory-policy` configuration directive**.
     
     - **Common Policies:**
       
       - `volatile-lru`: Evicts Least Recently Used (LRU) keys that *have a TTL set*.
       - `allkeys-lru`: Evicts Least Recently Used (LRU) keys, *regardless of whether they have a TTL*. This makes Valkey behave much like a traditional caching system like **memcached**.
       - `noeviction`: New writes will return errors if memory limit is hit.
     
     - **Configuration Example (Conceptual - in `valkey.conf`):**
       
       ```
       # Set a maximum memory limit (e.g., 256 megabytes)
       maxmemory 256mb
       # Set the eviction policy
       maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
       # Optional: Disable persistence if only using as a volatile cache
       # save ""
       # appendonly no
       ```
       
       *Briefly demonstrate setting `maxmemory` and `maxmemory-policy` via `CONFIG SET` in `valkey-cli` , e.g., `CONFIG SET maxmemory 100mb`, `CONFIG SET maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`.)*
   
   - **Enhancing Caching Performance and Efficiency:**
     
     - **Pipelining:** Valkey communicates via a Request/Response protocol. Network latency (Round Trip Time - RTT) can add overhead. Pipelining allows your client (e.g., `valkey-py`) to send multiple commands to Valkey in a single batch without waiting for each individual reply. Valkey processes them and sends all replies back in one go, significantly reducing RTT impact and improving throughput for bulk operations.
     - **Client-Side Caching (Tracking):** An advanced feature where the Valkey server helps the client maintain a local cache in its own memory. When keys cached locally by the client are modified on the Valkey server, the server sends invalidation messages to the client. This offers even lower latency by avoiding network round trips completely for cache hits. *(Note: This is an advanced concept requiring careful implementation in client libraries.)*
     - **Memory Optimization Techniques:** Valkey automatically optimizes memory usage for smaller data structures (e.g., small hashes, lists, sets of integers, and sorted sets are encoded very efficiently). Using **Hashes to represent objects with multiple fields** is explicitly recommended as a memory-efficient practice compared to storing each field as a separate string key.
