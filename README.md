## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

To get the most out of this training and run the code examples, you'll need the following installed on your system:

* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads): For cloning the repository.
* [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/get-started): To easily run a Valkey server without local installation.
* [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/): For managing the Valkey container.
* [**Python 3.8+**](https://www.python.org/downloads/): The programming language used for all code examples.
* [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/): Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and start exploring the training materials:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsbhullar/valkey-enterprise-training.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
   
   

2. **Start the Valkey Server:**
   Navigate to the root of the cloned repository and use Docker Compose to spin up a Valkey instance:
   
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   
   This command will download the `valkey/valkey` image (if not already present) and start a Valkey server listening on port `6379`.

3. **Explore the Concepts:**
   Head over to the `concepts/` directory to start with the theoretical explanations. It's recommended to follow them in order:
   
   * [01 - Introduction to Valkey](concepts/01-introduction-to-valkey.md)
   * [02 - Core Data Structures](concepts/02-core-data-structures.md)
   * [03 - Caching Strategies](concepts/03-caching-strategies.md)
   * [04 - Publish/Subscribe](concepts/04-pub-sub.md)
   * [05 - Message Queues](concepts/05-message-queues.md)

4. **Run Code Examples (Python):**
   Each concept file may refer to corresponding code examples. Navigate to the relevant example folder within `code-examples/python/`.
   
   For example, to run the caching strategies example:
   
   ```bash
   cd code-examples/python/03-caching-strategies
   # Install Python dependencies for this specific example
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Run the example script
   python main.py
   ```
   
   _Please refer to the `README.md` within each specific example folder for detailed instructions on how to run that particular demonstration._

5. **Stop the Valkey Server:**
   Once you're done with your session, you can stop and remove the Valkey container:
   
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```
